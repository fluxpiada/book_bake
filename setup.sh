✅ Set up "$TITLE" by $AUTHOR.

   Next:
     1. Replace images/cover.png with your own cover.
     2. Write your chapters in manuscript/$LANGCODE/ — delete the samples.
     3. Fill in the contact block in book.yaml before submitting anywhere.
     4. Build:  epub/bake_book_epub.sh --version=v0.1.0

   Everything else is in book.yaml and README.md.
